## How to contribute to our Rtype project

#### **Did you find a bug ?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/EpitechPromo2025/B-CPP-500-NCY-5-1-rtype-clovis.schneider/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/EpitechPromo2025/B-CPP-500-NCY-5-1-rtype-clovis.schneider/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a simple demonstration of what doesn’t work.


#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug ?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please read the [Contributing to our Rtype project](lien à changer) guide to learn more about our project’s coding conventions.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch ?**

* Changes that are cosmetic in nature and that don't add anything significant to the stability or functioning of our project will generally not be accepted, because it is a school project.

#### **Would you like to add a new function or change parts of our project?**

* As said before, this is a school project, so don’t open a problem on GitHub, but you can send an email to [these addresses](https://github.com/EpitechPromo2025/B-CPP-500-NCY-5-1-rtype-clovis.schneider#team-), to suggest what you would like to change.
