## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities to
**[damien.demontis@epitech.eu](mailto:security@ory.sh)**. You will receive a response from
us within 48 hours. If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon
as possible depending on complexity but historically within a few days.
